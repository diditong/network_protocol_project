What I Have Done?
For the algorithm to find connections, I used std::unordered_map
instead of using offsets as recommended in the project description.

Instead of using fork(), I used std::thread, and blocked SIGPIPE
so instead I/O operations will return -1/0 and set errno.  If this
indicates the client is gone, we gracefully exit the thread.  This is
equivalent to (if not better than) fork.

Code Files and What They Do:
serverA.cpp/h = serverA main
serverB.cpp/h = serverB main
common.cpp/h = common code, utilities, common serverA/B code
servermain.cpp = server main, uses std::thread for forking
client.cpp = client

Code contains comments on flow and logic

Idiosyncrasy: Uses std::thread instead of fork, from client perspective
this isn't really observable, but this will mean only one process with
many threads instead of many single threaded processes.  Also uses C++17
and links with the pthread library.

Reused Code: Nothing directly copied and pasted.  Read a lot of
StackOverflow and linux/POSIX documentation
